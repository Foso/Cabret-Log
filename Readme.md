## Introduction üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is an Kotlin Compiler Plugin that enables Annotation-triggered method call logging. 
 
Simply add **@DebugLog** to your methods and it will automatically log all arguments that are passed to the function.

```kotlin
@DebugLog
fun doSomething(name: String, age: Int, isLoggedIn: Boolean = false) {
    //Do something
}
```
